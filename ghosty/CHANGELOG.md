All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.2] — 2026-06-28

### Changed

- **Project renamed `phantom` → `ghosty`** — source dir `src/phantom/` → `src/ghosty/`, all imports updated, pyproject.toml package name changed to `ghosty-cli`
- **CLI entry points** — `phantom` removed; three new commands: `ghosty` (primary), `ghost` (alias), `gho` (shortest)
- **Config paths** — `~/.config/phantom/` → `~/.config/ghosty/`
- **Env var** — `$PHANTOM_CHEATSHEET` → `$GHOSTY_CHEATSHEET`
- **README rewritten** — new ghost SVG logo (`logo/ghosty.svg`), SVG icons (Feather) replace emojis across all sections, install now shows HTTPS/SSH/gh CLI methods, usage table cleaned up
- **Cheatsheet renamed** — `phantom-cheatsheet.md` → `ghosty-cheatsheet.md`, all internal refs updated

## [2.0.1] — 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- **Crash on every button click in Detail/Run screens** — replaced `asyncio.run()` with `await` inside Textual's async event loop; was raising `RuntimeError` on any action (F1)
- **Apply button pushed empty RunScreen** — `action_apply_action` now constructs `RunScreen` with the selected action pre-loaded; was pushing a blank screen with no actions (A6)
- **Hardcoded user-specific path in 4 files** — centralized cheatsheet resolution in `catalog.get_cheatsheet_path()` with `$PHANTOM_CHEATSHEET` env var and `~/.config/phantom/cheatsheet.md` fallback; was hardcoding `~/MasterBase/privacy/...` (S1)
- **Silent failure on non-macOS** — added `sys.platform == "darwin"` guard at CLI entry; was attempting to run with confusing errors (S2)

### Changed

- `pyproject.toml`: pruned 6 dead dependencies (`sh`, `asciimatics`, `wcwidth`, `platformdirs`, `textual-plotext`, `textual-fspicker`) — declared but never imported (D1)
- `src/phantom/screens/catalog.py`, `home.py`, `app.py`: dropped unused `Path` imports after path centralization

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-27

### Added
- Complete Python + Textual TUI replacement of the v1 Go/Bubble Tea prototype
- 20 chapters of macOS privacy and security hardening guidance (80+ actions)
- Curated action catalog from the macOS Privacy & Security Guide (drduh)
- 6 interactive TUI screens: Home, Catalog, Detail, Run, Doctor, Replay
- 4 TUI widgets: StatusBar, ProgressGrid, ActionProgressCell, ActionCard
- Snapshot → mutate → verify → undo workflow engine
- Automatic snapshots before every mutable action (JSONL store at `~/.config/phantom/store`)
- First-class rollback (`phantom undo`, dependency-ordered inverse replay)
- Live parallel execution grid (~30 fps, per-cell ETA and log tails)
- Doctor mode — checks SIP, Apple Silicon, FileVault, secure boot, brew, sudo, network
- Dry-run by default with explicit preview and confirmation
- `--json` output flag for scripting and CI integration
- Apple-grade TUI palette (`#7C5CFF` violet, `#22D3EE` cyan, `#FFC857` amber)
- Gradient figlet banner, animated status pills, keyframed transitions
- Click-based CLI with two entry points (`phantom` primary, `ghost` alias)
- Pydantic v2 models for catalog entries, actions, and execution state
- Async subprocess management via `asyncio` + `sh` library
- `uv`-based project management (uv.lock, uv.toml)

### Changed
- Complete architecture rewrite from Go → Python
- Project renamed to `phantom` with `ghosty` retained as legacy alias
- Action catalog expanded from 6 → 80+ items across 20 chapters
- Installation buttons replaced with actual `brew install` / `defaults write` execution

### Removed
- Go Bubble Tea prototype (v1)
- Placeholder install buttons
- Static screenshot-of-UI demo approach

### Fixed
- No more single-step manual hardening — full snapshot → verify → undo lifecycle
- Proper terminal capability detection (`NO_COLOR`, `TERM=dumb`, CJK widths)
- Zombie-free subprocess management
